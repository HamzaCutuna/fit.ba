      "quote": "Recognizing and following the aspirations and desires of young people who planned to continue their education at one of the higher education institutions of our University, in 1996 we launched an initiative to form a Computer Science Study at the University \"Džemal Bijedić\". The Academic Council formed a Commission tasked with preparing a feasibility study for the establishment of Computer Science Studies. The study confirmed the great interest of young people and showed the justification for establishing a two-year Computer Science Study and confirmed the assumptions of successful work and development. On that basis, the University Council made a decision on October 10, 1997, to establish and start the work of a new higher education institution. By establishing Computer Science Studies at the University, we met the wishes of a large number of young people from Bosnia and Herzegovina to acquire education in the field of computer science in their own country.",
      "content1": "The dynamic growth and development of the Study imposed the need for its transformation into the Faculty of Information Technologies. The Academic Council and the University Council accepted the Feasibility Study that was prepared in that sense. Accordingly, a decision was made, and the cantonal court of the HN canton performed the court registration of that higher education institution on February 17, 2003.",
      "content2": "From the beginning, we understood that the dynamic development of information technologies can be followed by innovating, supplementing and correcting the Curriculum and introducing new methods and new forms of interaction in the teaching process. Thus, in ten years of our existence, we have changed or supplemented the content of the Curriculum six times. The seriousness of our approach to this work was also contributed by our engagement in the TEMPUS project for the development of an adequate curriculum for the education of computer scientists. We will continue this trend of curriculum development of our Faculty in the future.",
      "content3": "From the 2001/02 school year, we also organized distance learning. Our efforts will be more focused in that direction in the future. In the 2002/03 school year, we also started teaching at postgraduate studies and thus stepped into the strategy of solving the problem of staff shortage."
